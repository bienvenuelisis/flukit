## Get started

To get started with **Flukit**, you'll need to add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file. Here's an example of how to do this:

``` yaml
dependencies:
  flukit:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/charles9904/flukit
```

Once you've added the dependency, run `flutter packages get` to install it.
You're ready to start using **Flukit** in your app! Check out the next section to learn how to get started.
That's it! You should now have **Flukit** installed and ready to use in your Flutter project. If you have any issues with the installation process, please refer to the Support and Troubleshooting section below.

## Usage

To use **Flukit**, you'll need to import it into your Dart code:

``` dart
import 'package:your_library_name/your_library_name.dart';
```

From there, you can use the various widgets and features provided by the library. Here's an example of how to create a simple Avatar widget:

``` dart
FluAvatar(size: 25); /// Yes, it's as simple as that :)
```

This will create an avatar with a default illustration since an image or label is not provided.

**Flukit** provides a wide range of customizable widgets and features that you can use to build complex and beautiful user interfaces. The next section will show you all available UI widgets.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues that users might encounter when using **Flukit**, and how to fix them:

### "Cannot run on this platform" Error

If you're seeing an error message that says "Cannot run on this platform" when you try to run your app, it's likely because your device is not supported by the version of Flutter you're using. Try updating to the latest version of Flutter and try again.

### "Dependency not found" Error

If you're seeing an error message that says "Dependency not found" when you try to run your app, it's likely because you've forgotten to include **Flukit** in your pubspec.yaml file. Make sure that you've added the correct dependency to your file, and run flutter packages get to install it.

### Performance Issues

If you're experiencing performance issues with your app, it's possible that you're using too many expensive widgets or features at once. Try optimizing your app by removing unnecessary widgets, using the const keyword to make your widgets more efficient, or using the ListView.builder method instead of ListView to lazy-load content.
